# The Hero and the Monsters
My first, big 'hobby' project: a python-pygame, isometric view fighting game.  
It's already working, but it's not finished yet - scores, level logic and more still have to be added.
<br>
## FIGHT THE ORCS IF YOU DARE!
Just download this repository (with Python working) and run "start.py".

## FIGHTING INSTRUCTIONS  
<br>
  
### Fight with the Mouse and the keys 'W', 'A', 'S' & 'D' by clicking on the enemy while holding the keys:
'W':   UP  
'A':   LEFT  
'S':   STABBING  
'D':   RIGHT  

<br>

### RIGHT MOUSE CLICK ON ENEMY: BLOCK
...you will have to check which direction to block by watching the enemy's attack movement.  
--> if there's a skull above the attacking enemy, it means he will attack again (combo-attack) 
without you having the chance to fight back - you'll have to *block* again!  
<br>
  
### LEFT MOUSE CLICK ON ENEMY: ATTACK
...you will have to check which direction to attack by watching the symbols above the enemy's head:  
--> bigger shields mean he's likely to block the attack - so aim for directions with no or smaller shields.  
--> swords in the symbols mean: If you attack the enemy in that direction, you can attack again (combo-attack-chance!)  
<br>
  
### DOORS:
...are opened/closed via right-click  
<br>
